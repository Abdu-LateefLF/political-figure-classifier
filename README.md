## Political Figure Classifier

The Political Figure Classifier is a machine learning application designed to classify political figures based on images. The model uses SVM (Support Vector Machine). The application features a responsive front-end built with Vue.js and a back-end powered by Flask, which serves the classification model through a RESTful API.
